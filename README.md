# JavaScript-Practice-Problems
Repo containing problems I tackle while learning JavaScript. Also, a list of definitions on JavaScript syntax to refer back to as I build my arsenal of code. Possibly, examples to follow up the definitions later on.

## JavaScript Syntax

**Subtype** - A datatype that is related to another datatype by some notion of substitution, meaning that program elements, typically subroutines or functions, written to operate on elements of the supertype can also operate on elements of the subtype.


**Prototype** - When a function is created in JavaScript, JS engine adds a prototype property to the function. This prototype property is an object (called as prototype object) and has a constructor property by default. The constructor property points back to the function on which prototype object is a property. We can access the function's prototype object as a property. You can access the function's prototype property by using the syntax: functionName.prototype
